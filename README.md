# To_Do_List_Express
A full-stack React to-do list app where users can register, log in, and manage tasks. The backend, built with Node.js and Express, uses MongoDB for data storage. Middleware ensures security by restricting non-JSON requests, enforcing username validation, and limiting task length. Only authenticated users can create, edit, and delete tasks.
